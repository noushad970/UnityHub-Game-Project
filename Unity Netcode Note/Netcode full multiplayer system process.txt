First I have to install two package named "Netcode for gameobject" and "Multiplayer tools" from unity registry.
Than I have to create a gameobject named "NetworkManager" and add Game Manager Script to the NetworkManager. 
Than I have to select the gameobject Network Manager and select transport to unity transport. 
Now I need to add the player to the scene view.
Now add NetworkObject script to the player and make a prefab of the player and add it in network manager's player prefab.
Than I have to select networkManager and click on + icon on Network prefab and add the player prefab in it.
Now I have to add a canvas and three button named SERVER, HOST and CLIENT which will be placed on top right of the screen.
Add a script name NetworkManagerUI to the panel of the button canvas. named the panel as NetworkManagerUI.
again go to the NetworkManager and change log level from normal to developer.
Add Network Transform script to the Player prefab.
Now for client network transform I need to copy " https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop.git?path=/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop#main "
url and go to unity editor, package manager, click on + icon and than click on add from git and paste the link and download.
After that remove Network transform script from player prefab and add client network transform to the player prefab.
If we want to spawn an object in both player screen than we need to add that gameobject on scene than we need to add script 
NetworkObject to the game object. and make a prefab of that object and delete that. than we also have to add the prefab to the 
network prefab list. 
If we want to transform the animation of the character to the other screen than we just need to create a script name OwnerNetworkAnimator and paste the following code:
using Unity.Netcode.Components;
public class OwnerNetworkAnimator : NetworkAnimator
{    protected override bool OnIsServerAuthoritative()
    {
        return false;
    }
}
if we want to create or control something from server we just need to make the script network Behaviour and if update function i have to 
apply one condition on update method
if(!isServer)return;
if I want to sync somefunction for both client and host than I need to use Rpc system.
and static is not suitable for Rpc. Example

void method()
{
methodServerRpc();
}
[ServerRpc]
void methodServerRpc()
{
methodClientRpc();
}
[ClientRpc]
void methodClientRpc()
{
    //code for both host and client
}

//use's of network variable
Network variable is another type of method by which we can sync network data.
example: public NetworkVariable<float> netVariable;
and we mush use OnNetworkSpawn method exchange of Start or Awake



//thats all for netcode
Now lets talk about lobby
for creating a lobby first I need to add lobby package to the project.

//Spawning position system
for spawn a object in different position I first need to add a list of Vector3 type. than I have to assign the value from the 
unity editor,
than I need to write this code on spawning an object.
[serializedfield]
private list<Vector3> spawnPositionList;
private void Override OnNetworkSpawn()
{
transform.position=spawnPositionList[(int)OwnerClientId];
}

Network variable is use to sync data from any states of a server. for example if a player join late in the server network variable will 
automatically sync that state data in client player screen.
