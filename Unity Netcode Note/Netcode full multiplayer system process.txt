First I have to install two package named "Netcode for gameobject" and "Multiplayer tools" from unity registry.
Than I have to create a gameobject named "NetworkManager" and add Game Manager Script to the NetworkManager. 
Than I have to select the gameobject Network Manager and select transport to unity transport. 
Now I need to add the player to the scene view.
